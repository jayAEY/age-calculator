## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View an age in years, months, and days after submitting a valid date through the form
- Receive validation errors if:
  - Any field is empty when the form is submitted
  - The day number is not between 1-31
  - The month number is not between 1-12
  - The year is in the future
  - The date is invalid e.g. 31/04/1991 (there are 30 days in April)
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page
- **Bonus**: See the age numbers animate to their final number when the form is submitted

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [TailwindCSS](https://nextjs.org/) - CSS framework
- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) - Frontend Build Tool


### Continued development

This project took a lot longer than I expected. At first, I thought it would be a fairly straightforward way to practice styling with tailwind. It turns out, things like handling dates, creating custom error messages and creating functions to handle validity were a lot of work. Thankfully, the animation was easier than I expected.
